Oh, my beautiful mother. She told me, son, in life you're gonna go far. If you do it right, you'll love where you are. Just know, wherever you go. You can always come home. 240 thousand miles from the moon. We've come a long way to belong here. To share this view of the night. A glorious night. Over the horizon is another bright sky. Oh, my, my, how beautiful. Oh, my irrefutable father. He told me, son, sometimes it may seem dark. But the absence of the light is a necessary part. Just know, you're never alone. You can always come back home. Home. Home. You can always come back. Every road is a slippery slope. But there is always a hand that you can hold on to. Looking deeper through the telescope. You can see that your home's inside of you. Just know, that wherever you go. No, you're never alone. You will always get back home. Home. Home. 93 million miles from the sun. People get ready, get ready. Cause here it comes, it's a light. A beautiful light, over the horizon. Into our eyes"

Angel,Spend all your time waiting. For that second chance. For a break that would make it okay. There's always some reason. To feel not good enough. And it's hard at the end of the day. I need some distraction. Oh beautiful release. Memories seep from my veins. Let me be empty. Oh and weightless and maybe. I'll find some peace tonight. In the arms of the angel. Fly away from here. From this dark cold hotel room. And the endlessness that you feel. You are pulled from the wreckage. Of your silent reverie. You're in the arms of the angel. Maybe you find some comfort here. So tired of the straight line. And everywhere you turn. There's vultures and thieves at your back. And the storm keeps on twisting. You keep on building the lies. That you make up for all that you lack. It don't make no difference. Escaping one last time. It's easier to believe in this sweet madness oh. This glorious sadness that brings me to my knees. In the arms of the angel. Fly away from here. From this dark cold hotel room. And the endlessness that you feel. You are pulled from the wreckage. Of your silent reverie. You're in the arms of the angel. Maybe you find some comfort here. You're in the arms of the angel. Maybe you find some comfort here
Behind Blue Eyes,"No one knows what its like, to be the bad man,. To be the sad man, behind blue eyes.. No one knows what its like, to be hated,. To be fated, to telling only lies.. But my dreams they aren't as empty,. As my conscience seems to be.. I have hours, only lonely.. My love is vengeance, that's never free.. No one knows what its like, to feel these feelings,. Like I do, and I blame you. No one bites back as hard on their anger,. None of my pain or woe, can show through.. But my dreams, they aren't as empty,. As my conscience seems to be.. I have hours, only lonely. My love is vengeance, that's never free. When my fist clenches, crack it open,. Before I use it and lose my cool.. When I smile, tell me some bad news. Before I laugh and act like a fool.. And if I swallow anything evil,. Put your finger down my throat.. And if I shiver, please give me your blanket,. Keep me warm, let me wear your coat.. No one knows what its like, to be the bad man,. To be the sad man, behind blue eyes."
Brazil (Com Frank Sinatra),"Brazil, where hearts were entertaining June. We stood beneath an amber moon. And softly murmured ""Someday soon"". We kissed and clung together. Then, tomorrow was another day. The morning found me miles away. With still a million things to say. Now, when twilight dims the sky above. Recalling thrills of our love. There's one thing I'm certain of. Return I will to old Brazil. Then, tomorrow was another day. The morning found me miles away. With still a million things to say.

Dust In The Wind,"Dust in the wind. All we are is dust in the wind. I close my eyes. Only for a moment,. And the moment's gone.. All my dreams,. Pass before my eyes, a curiousity.. Dust in the wind,. All they are is dust in the wind.. Same old song,. Just a drop of water in an endless sea.. All we do. Crumbles to the ground,. Though we refuse to see.. Dust in the wind,. All we are is dust in the wind.. Now, don't hang on. Nothing lasts forever. But the earth and sky.. It slips away. And all your money. Won't another minute buy.. Dust in the wind. All we are is dust in the wind.. Dust in the wind. Everything is dust in the wind."
Fallen,"Heaven bent to take my hand. And lead me through the fire. Be the long awaited answer. To a long and painful fight. Truth be told I've tried my best. But somewhere along the way. I got caught up in all there was to offer. And the cost was so much more than I could bear. Though I've tried, I've fallen.... I have sunk so low. I have messed up. Better I should know. So don't come round here. And tell me I told you so.... We all begin with good intent. Love was raw and young. We believed that we could change ourselves. THe past could be undone. But we carry on our backs the burden. Time always reveals. The lonely light of morning. The wound that would not heal. It's the bitter taste of losing everything. That I have held so dear.. I've fallen.... I have sunk so low. I have messed up. Better I should know. So don't come round here. And tell me I told you so.... Heaven bent to take my hand. Nowhere left to turn. I'm lost to those I thought were friends. To everyone I know. Oh they turned their heads embarassed. Pretend that they don't see. But it's one missed step. You'll slip before you know it. And there doesn't seem a way to be redeemed. Though I've tried, I've fallen.... I have sunk so low. I have messed up. Better I should know. So don't come round here. And tell me I told you so..."

Nothing Else Matters,"So close no matter how far. Couldn't be much more from the heart. Forever trusting who we are. And nothing else matters. Never opened myself this way.

Ode To My Family,"Understand the things I say,. Don't turn away from me. 'Cause I spent half my life out there. You wouldn't disagree. D'you see me, d'you see. Do you like me, do you like me standing there. D'you notice, d'you know. Do you see me, do you see me. Does anyone care. Unhappiness, where's when I was young. And we didn't give a damn. 'Cause we were raised. To see life as fun and take it if we can. My mother, my mother she hold me,. Did she hold me when I was out there. My father, my father, he liked me. Oh he liked me, does anyone care. Understand what I've become,. It wasn't my design. And people everywhere think. Something better than I am,. But I miss you. I miss. 'Cause I liked it, cause I liked it. When I was out there. D'you know this, d'you know. You did not find me, you did not find. Does anyone care. Unhappiness, was when I was young. And we didn't give a damn. 'Cause we were raised. To see life as fun and take it if we can. My mother, my mother she hold me,. Did she hold me when I was out there. My father, my father, he liked me. Oh he liked me. Does anyone care, does anyone care?"
One Of Us,"If God had a name what would it be?. And would you call it to his face?. If you were faced with Him in all His glory. What would you ask if you had just one question?. Yeah, yeah, God is great. Yeah, yeah, God is good. Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah. What if God was one of us?. Just a slob like one of us. Just a stranger on the bus. Tryin' to make his way home?. If God had a face what would it look like?. And would you want to see, if seeing meant. That you would have to believe in things like heaven. And in Jesus and the saints, and all the prophets?. Yeah, yeah, God is great. Yeah, yeah, God is good. Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah. What if God was one of us?. Just a slob like one of us. Just a stranger on the bus. Tryin' to make his way home?. Tryin' to make his way home?. Back up to heaven all alone. Nobody calling on the phone. 'Cept for the Pope maybe in Rome. Yeah, yeah, God is great. Yeah, yeah, God is good. Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah. What if God was one of us?. Just a slob like one of us. Just a stranger on the bus. Tryin' to make his way home?. Like a holly rolling stone. Back up to heaven all alone. No, just tryin' to make his way home. Nobody calling on the phone. Cept for the Pope maybe in Rome"
Over the Rainbow (Com Michael Bolton),"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high. There's a land that I've heard of. Once in a lullaby. Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue. And the dreams that you dare to dream. Really do come true. Some day I'll wish upon a star. And wake up where the clouds are far behind me. Where troubles melt like lemon drops. Away above the chimney tops. That's where you'll find me. Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly. Birds fly over the rainbow. Why, then, oh why can't I?. If happy little blue birds fly. Beyond the rainbow. Why oh why, can't I?"
Sweet Water,"Sweet water - water of the spring. So clear, so pure. Where all my dreams begin.. Sweet water - dark water of the river. Take away my sorrows, my soul deliver.. Sweet water - water, waterfall. Let me into you hall of light.. Sweet water - water of the lake. So quiet, so deep. There's a lady there for you to meet.. Sweet water - water of the rain. Carry away the bad thoughts. And is lost - make me sane.. Sweet water - water of the desert. I will find you hidden well. And drink from you forever.. Sweet water - water of the sea. Dolphins, whales and mermaids. Sing your song to me."
The Boxer,"I am just a poor boy. Though my stories seldom told. I have squandered my existence. For a pocket full of mumbles such are promises. All lies and jests, still a man hears. What he wants to ear and disregards the rest. When I left my home and my family. I was no more than a boy. In the company of strangers. In the quiet of the railwaystation running scared. Laying low, seeking aout the poorer quarters. Where the ragged people go. Looking for the places only they would know.. (chorus). Lie la lie.... Asking only workmans wages. I come looking for a job but I get no offers. Just a come on from the whores on 7th avenue. I do declare. There where times when I was so lonesome. I took some comfort there. La la lie lie lie lie lie. (chorus). Now I'm laying out my winter clothes. And wishing I was gone going home. Where the new york city winters aren't bleeding me. Leading me, going home. In the clearing stands a boxer. And a fighter by his trade. And he carrys the reminders. Of every glove that layed him down. Or cut him till he cried out. In his anger and his shame. I am leaving I am leaving. But the fighter still remains. (chorus)"

Believer,"Really would like to see the light shine. Water run down from my eye (light shine). All day. There's a mainstream with the main dreams. But waterfalls start with a little stream. Even Kubrick started with a small scene. Before it became The Shining. If your coming from the hood work on getting knowledge. If your from the front line and you wanna survive. I didn't choose the battles but the battles choose me. From the bullet hitting my cousin, we'll see. I've been in the game now 5.3. Little shorty bird got shorties after me. I stay humble cause the shit I seen. Cos I already know theres only one me. I really would like to see the stars shine. But I like getting covered up in hard times. I need to let loose. If the water ran dry fill it up with juice. All day, need a believer. There's no mean & there's more me. Every tree started with a little bean. Everything you go through at 17 -. Will it still count at 70?. If I'm coming from the street then I'm getting money. But my deals in the bank are well planning. I didn't choose the music but the music chose me. The art hitting your speakers making it bleed. I been thinking bout what affects me. The will to survive is always in me. Every glass of water grows, what I be?. And every glass of liquor gets me tipsy. I really would like to see the stars shine. But I like getting covered up in hard times. I need to let loose. If the water ran dry fill it up with juice. All day, need a believer. It's about people, not money. Light up the parliament, turn the car key. I could be a genius, I could be a cheat. It's a thin line and I'm fucking with it. I didn't choose this topic but this topic chose me. I'm dancing on the rubble permanently. I'm cut from a cloth that you made me. Driving down the alley these cats know me. It's not cool, then we bring heat. If there's no heat then it's discreet. If it's got your feet, then it's on me. Anything on NEET has got that beat"

Bring me that ho. Put her on the table. And put her in my claw. I'll put her down in my jaw. To my belly, to my toe. I'll shit on that ho. And drop her to the floor. Big branch. Men are like pearls. They look good with my curls. I string em to get the best necklace in the world. In the states of the world. All women wanna lay. But it's man's world so keep him at bay. You can fuck a man, mack a man. Tell 'em that you're gay. Tell him real love ain't on BET. Sex is so cheap, I get it at KFC. When its meaningless why they do R&B. Bring her to my door now. Bring me that ho. Put her on the table. And put her in my claw. I'll put her down in my jaw. To my belly, to my toe. I'll shit on that ho. And drop her to the floor. Big branch. I ate my chips and I washed my plate. Thought about women that take that bait. Men with stamina or money on the plate. Can get a woman thinking her period is late. Thanks to Jesus, I got my own estate. If I let you in, will you run off with my maid?. All men are just so fickle these days. To find a really good one. I keep on getting laid. Bring her to my door now. Bring me that ho. Put her on the table. And put her in my claw. I'll put her down in my jaw. To my belly, to my toe. I'll shit on that ho. And drop her to the floor"

And now that we really rock now, we're macho. and that's what we wanted all along. And that's right, that's the laws of our ghetto. And now we see that things are not simple. I can't have videos made by Sony, yo. Spring films of Rocky and Rambo. Roll model from bollywood to jungle. We learned about using from our heroes. Aviator shades, no winds with the grenade. Kicking out in camouflage and band-aid. Homemade tin records that ricochet. When it's hot, we all make lemonade. And now that we really rock now, we're macho. and that's what we wanted all along.

First of all I wanna say I don't even know why you act that way. My name is Maya and people always say. I act kinda strange like a dooba weh. I like fish and mango pickle.

Rode the BMX, we walked through the bush. The boys fight to ride it but I just let them push. Keith stole an egg from a lil kookoo. Kept it safe in his mouth, while he danced the jookoo jookoo. There_—Ès only one ocean that got fish left. One day we_—Èll have to be a really good chef. And I don_—Èt mean us in the bush making meth. Boys, if you catch meth, you catch your death. When I said that Keith sneezed and had a chick. Broke the little egg in his mouth in little bits. When it's hot we go down the river and swim. When we go fishing we're catching a brim. When the river's high we jump off the bridge. And then we go home and play some didge. When it's hot we go down the river and swim. When we go fishing we're catching a brim.

And he's nice looking,. I smile at him and say,. ""Hey, what's cooking?"". And when he holds me tight. And puts his cheek to mine,. I feel so terrific,. So colossal, so divine.. I feel like Mickey Mouse. Was running up and down my spine.. Bum-tee-dum-pum pum-pum-pum,. I'm completely overcome,. Bum-tee-dum-pum, when I love, I love.. Oh, when I love, I love,. It is no imitation;. And when I kiss, I kiss. With such anticipation;. And when I coo, I coo,. But I need coo-operation.. If I say, ""Stop, please go away,"". And I am acting cool;. If you stop and go away. Then you are just a fool.. Bum-tee-dum-pum pum-pum-pum,. Bum-tee-dum-pum pum-pum-pum;. Something in me sings when I'm caressed.. Mama eu quiero;. Bum-tee-dum-pum pum-pum-pum,. Bum-tee-dum-pum pum-pum-pum;. When I give, I always give my best.. Oh, when I meet a man,. And he's nice looking,. I smile at him and say,. ""Hey, what's cooking?"". And when he holds me tight. And puts his cheek to mine,. I feel so terrific,. So colossal, so divine.. I feel like Mickey Mouse. Was running up and down my spine.. Bum-tee-dum-pum pum-pum-pum,. I'm completely overcome,. Bum-tee-dum-pum, when I love, I love"
