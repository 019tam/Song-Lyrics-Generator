Oh, my beautiful mother. She told me, son, in life you're gonna go far. If you do it right, you'll love where you are. Just know, wherever you go. You can always come home. 240 thousand miles from the moon. We've come a long way to belong here. To share this view of the night. A glorious night. Over the horizon is another bright sky. Oh, my, my, how beautiful. Oh, my irrefutable father. He told me, son, sometimes it may seem dark. But the absence of the light is a necessary part. Just know, you're never alone. You can always come back home. Home. Home. You can always come back. Every road is a slippery slope. But there is always a hand that you can hold on to. Looking deeper through the telescope. You can see that your home's inside of you. Just know, that wherever you go. No, you're never alone. You will always get back home. Home. Home. 93 million miles from the sun. People get ready, get ready. Cause here it comes, it's a light. A beautiful light, over the horizon. Into our eyes"

Angel,Spend all your time waiting. For that second chance. For a break that would make it okay. There's always some reason. To feel not good enough. And it's hard at the end of the day. I need some distraction. Oh beautiful release. Memories seep from my veins. Let me be empty. Oh and weightless and maybe. I'll find some peace tonight. In the arms of the angel. Fly away from here. From this dark cold hotel room. And the endlessness that you feel. You are pulled from the wreckage. Of your silent reverie. You're in the arms of the angel. Maybe you find some comfort here. So tired of the straight line. And everywhere you turn. There's vultures and thieves at your back. And the storm keeps on twisting. You keep on building the lies. That you make up for all that you lack. It don't make no difference. Escaping one last time. It's easier to believe in this sweet madness oh. This glorious sadness that brings me to my knees. In the arms of the angel. Fly away from here. From this dark cold hotel room. And the endlessness that you feel. You are pulled from the wreckage. Of your silent reverie. You're in the arms of the angel. Maybe you find some comfort here. You're in the arms of the angel. Maybe you find some comfort here
Behind Blue Eyes,"No one knows what its like, to be the bad man,. To be the sad man, behind blue eyes.. No one knows what its like, to be hated,. To be fated, to telling only lies.. But my dreams they aren't as empty,. As my conscience seems to be.. I have hours, only lonely.. My love is vengeance, that's never free.. No one knows what its like, to feel these feelings,. Like I do, and I blame you. No one bites back as hard on their anger,. None of my pain or woe, can show through.. But my dreams, they aren't as empty,. As my conscience seems to be.. I have hours, only lonely. My love is vengeance, that's never free. When my fist clenches, crack it open,. Before I use it and lose my cool.. When I smile, tell me some bad news. Before I laugh and act like a fool.. And if I swallow anything evil,. Put your finger down my throat.. And if I shiver, please give me your blanket,. Keep me warm, let me wear your coat.. No one knows what its like, to be the bad man,. To be the sad man, behind blue eyes."
Brazil (Com Frank Sinatra),"Brazil, where hearts were entertaining June. We stood beneath an amber moon. And softly murmured ""Someday soon"". We kissed and clung together. Then, tomorrow was another day. The morning found me miles away. With still a million things to say. Now, when twilight dims the sky above. Recalling thrills of our love. There's one thing I'm certain of. Return I will to old Brazil. Then, tomorrow was another day. The morning found me miles away. With still a million things to say.

Dust In The Wind,"Dust in the wind. All we are is dust in the wind. I close my eyes. Only for a moment,. And the moment's gone.. All my dreams,. Pass before my eyes, a curiousity.. Dust in the wind,. All they are is dust in the wind.. Same old song,. Just a drop of water in an endless sea.. All we do. Crumbles to the ground,. Though we refuse to see.. Dust in the wind,. All we are is dust in the wind.. Now, don't hang on. Nothing lasts forever. But the earth and sky.. It slips away. And all your money. Won't another minute buy.. Dust in the wind. All we are is dust in the wind.. Dust in the wind. Everything is dust in the wind."
Fallen,"Heaven bent to take my hand. And lead me through the fire. Be the long awaited answer. To a long and painful fight. Truth be told I've tried my best. But somewhere along the way. I got caught up in all there was to offer. And the cost was so much more than I could bear. Though I've tried, I've fallen.... I have sunk so low. I have messed up. Better I should know. So don't come round here. And tell me I told you so.... We all begin with good intent. Love was raw and young. We believed that we could change ourselves. THe past could be undone. But we carry on our backs the burden. Time always reveals. The lonely light of morning. The wound that would not heal. It's the bitter taste of losing everything. That I have held so dear.. I've fallen.... I have sunk so low. I have messed up. Better I should know. So don't come round here. And tell me I told you so.... Heaven bent to take my hand. Nowhere left to turn. I'm lost to those I thought were friends. To everyone I know. Oh they turned their heads embarassed. Pretend that they don't see. But it's one missed step. You'll slip before you know it. And there doesn't seem a way to be redeemed. Though I've tried, I've fallen.... I have sunk so low. I have messed up. Better I should know. So don't come round here. And tell me I told you so..."

Nothing Else Matters,"So close no matter how far. Couldn't be much more from the heart. Forever trusting who we are. And nothing else matters. Never opened myself this way.

Ode To My Family,"Understand the things I say,. Don't turn away from me. 'Cause I spent half my life out there. You wouldn't disagree. D'you see me, d'you see. Do you like me, do you like me standing there. D'you notice, d'you know. Do you see me, do you see me. Does anyone care. Unhappiness, where's when I was young. And we didn't give a damn. 'Cause we were raised. To see life as fun and take it if we can. My mother, my mother she hold me,. Did she hold me when I was out there. My father, my father, he liked me. Oh he liked me, does anyone care. Understand what I've become,. It wasn't my design. And people everywhere think. Something better than I am,. But I miss you. I miss. 'Cause I liked it, cause I liked it. When I was out there. D'you know this, d'you know. You did not find me, you did not find. Does anyone care. Unhappiness, was when I was young. And we didn't give a damn. 'Cause we were raised. To see life as fun and take it if we can. My mother, my mother she hold me,. Did she hold me when I was out there. My father, my father, he liked me. Oh he liked me. Does anyone care, does anyone care?"
One Of Us,"If God had a name what would it be?. And would you call it to his face?. If you were faced with Him in all His glory. What would you ask if you had just one question?. Yeah, yeah, God is great. Yeah, yeah, God is good. Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah. What if God was one of us?. Just a slob like one of us. Just a stranger on the bus. Tryin' to make his way home?. If God had a face what would it look like?. And would you want to see, if seeing meant. That you would have to believe in things like heaven. And in Jesus and the saints, and all the prophets?. Yeah, yeah, God is great. Yeah, yeah, God is good. Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah. What if God was one of us?. Just a slob like one of us. Just a stranger on the bus. Tryin' to make his way home?. Tryin' to make his way home?. Back up to heaven all alone. Nobody calling on the phone. 'Cept for the Pope maybe in Rome. Yeah, yeah, God is great. Yeah, yeah, God is good. Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah. What if God was one of us?. Just a slob like one of us. Just a stranger on the bus. Tryin' to make his way home?. Like a holly rolling stone. Back up to heaven all alone. No, just tryin' to make his way home. Nobody calling on the phone. Cept for the Pope maybe in Rome"
Over the Rainbow (Com Michael Bolton),"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high. There's a land that I've heard of. Once in a lullaby. Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue. And the dreams that you dare to dream. Really do come true. Some day I'll wish upon a star. And wake up where the clouds are far behind me. Where troubles melt like lemon drops. Away above the chimney tops. That's where you'll find me. Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly. Birds fly over the rainbow. Why, then, oh why can't I?. If happy little blue birds fly. Beyond the rainbow. Why oh why, can't I?"
Sweet Water,"Sweet water - water of the spring. So clear, so pure. Where all my dreams begin.. Sweet water - dark water of the river. Take away my sorrows, my soul deliver.. Sweet water - water, waterfall. Let me into you hall of light.. Sweet water - water of the lake. So quiet, so deep. There's a lady there for you to meet.. Sweet water - water of the rain. Carry away the bad thoughts. And is lost - make me sane.. Sweet water - water of the desert. I will find you hidden well. And drink from you forever.. Sweet water - water of the sea. Dolphins, whales and mermaids. Sing your song to me."
The Boxer,"I am just a poor boy. Though my stories seldom told. I have squandered my existence. For a pocket full of mumbles such are promises. All lies and jests, still a man hears. What he wants to ear and disregards the rest. When I left my home and my family. I was no more than a boy. In the company of strangers. In the quiet of the railwaystation running scared. Laying low, seeking aout the poorer quarters. Where the ragged people go. Looking for the places only they would know.. (chorus). Lie la lie.... Asking only workmans wages. I come looking for a job but I get no offers. Just a come on from the whores on 7th avenue. I do declare. There where times when I was so lonesome. I took some comfort there. La la lie lie lie lie lie. (chorus). Now I'm laying out my winter clothes. And wishing I was gone going home. Where the new york city winters aren't bleeding me. Leading me, going home. In the clearing stands a boxer. And a fighter by his trade. And he carrys the reminders. Of every glove that layed him down. Or cut him till he cried out. In his anger and his shame. I am leaving I am leaving. But the fighter still remains. (chorus)"

Believer,"Really would like to see the light shine. Water run down from my eye (light shine). All day. There's a mainstream with the main dreams. But waterfalls start with a little stream. Even Kubrick started with a small scene. Before it became The Shining. If your coming from the hood work on getting knowledge. If your from the front line and you wanna survive. I didn't choose the battles but the battles choose me. From the bullet hitting my cousin, we'll see. I've been in the game now 5.3. Little shorty bird got shorties after me. I stay humble cause the shit I seen. Cos I already know theres only one me. I really would like to see the stars shine. But I like getting covered up in hard times. I need to let loose. If the water ran dry fill it up with juice. All day, need a believer. There's no mean & there's more me. Every tree started with a little bean. Everything you go through at 17 -. Will it still count at 70?. If I'm coming from the street then I'm getting money. But my deals in the bank are well planning. I didn't choose the music but the music chose me. The art hitting your speakers making it bleed. I been thinking bout what affects me. The will to survive is always in me. Every glass of water grows, what I be?. And every glass of liquor gets me tipsy. I really would like to see the stars shine. But I like getting covered up in hard times. I need to let loose. If the water ran dry fill it up with juice. All day, need a believer. It's about people, not money. Light up the parliament, turn the car key. I could be a genius, I could be a cheat. It's a thin line and I'm fucking with it. I didn't choose this topic but this topic chose me. I'm dancing on the rubble permanently. I'm cut from a cloth that you made me. Driving down the alley these cats know me. It's not cool, then we bring heat. If there's no heat then it's discreet. If it's got your feet, then it's on me. Anything on NEET has got that beat"

Bring me that ho. Put her on the table. And put her in my claw. I'll put her down in my jaw. To my belly, to my toe. I'll shit on that ho. And drop her to the floor. Big branch. Men are like pearls. They look good with my curls. I string em to get the best necklace in the world. In the states of the world. All women wanna lay. But it's man's world so keep him at bay. You can fuck a man, mack a man. Tell 'em that you're gay. Tell him real love ain't on BET. Sex is so cheap, I get it at KFC. When its meaningless why they do R&B. Bring her to my door now. Bring me that ho. Put her on the table. And put her in my claw. I'll put her down in my jaw. To my belly, to my toe. I'll shit on that ho. And drop her to the floor. Big branch. I ate my chips and I washed my plate. Thought about women that take that bait. Men with stamina or money on the plate. Can get a woman thinking her period is late. Thanks to Jesus, I got my own estate. If I let you in, will you run off with my maid?. All men are just so fickle these days. To find a really good one. I keep on getting laid. Bring her to my door now. Bring me that ho. Put her on the table. And put her in my claw. I'll put her down in my jaw. To my belly, to my toe. I'll shit on that ho. And drop her to the floor"

And now that we really rock now, we're macho. and that's what we wanted all along. And that's right, that's the laws of our ghetto. And now we see that things are not simple. I can't have videos made by Sony, yo. Spring films of Rocky and Rambo. Roll model from bollywood to jungle. We learned about using from our heroes. Aviator shades, no winds with the grenade. Kicking out in camouflage and band-aid. Homemade tin records that ricochet. When it's hot, we all make lemonade. And now that we really rock now, we're macho. and that's what we wanted all along.

First of all I wanna say I don't even know why you act that way. My name is Maya and people always say. I act kinda strange like a dooba weh. I like fish and mango pickle.

Rode the BMX, we walked through the bush. The boys fight to ride it but I just let them push. Keith stole an egg from a lil kookoo. Kept it safe in his mouth, while he danced the jookoo jookoo. There_—Ès only one ocean that got fish left. One day we_—Èll have to be a really good chef. And I don_—Èt mean us in the bush making meth. Boys, if you catch meth, you catch your death. When I said that Keith sneezed and had a chick. Broke the little egg in his mouth in little bits. When it's hot we go down the river and swim. When we go fishing we're catching a brim. When the river's high we jump off the bridge. And then we go home and play some didge. When it's hot we go down the river and swim. When we go fishing we're catching a brim.

Over The Rainbow,"When all the world is a hopeless jumble. And the raindrops tumble all around. Heaven opens a magic lane. When all the clouds darken up the skyway. There's a rainbow highway to be found. Leading from your windowpane. To a place behind the sun. Just a step beyond the rain. Somewhere, over the rainbow. Way up high. There's a land that I dreamed of. Once in a lullabye. Somewhere, over the rainbow. Skies are blue. And the dreams that you dare to dream. Really do come true. Some day I'll wish upon a star. And wake up where the clouds are. Far. Behind me. Where troubles melt like lemon drops away. Above the chimney tops. That's where you'll find me. Somewhere, over the rainbow. Skies are blue. And the dreams that you dare to dream. Really do come true. If happy little bluebirds fly. Beyond the rainbow"

Take you to every party. 'cause all you wanted to do was dance. Now my baby's dancing. but she's dancing with another man. Although it hurts, I'll be the first to say that I was wrong. Oh, I know I'm probably much too late. To try and apologize for my mistakes. But I just want you to know. I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hand. Give you all his hours when he has the chance. Take you to every party. 'cause I remember how much you loved to dance. Do all the things I should've done. when I was your man.

This Love,I was so high I did not recognize. The fire burning in her eyes. The chaos that controlled my mind. Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane. Never to return again. But always in my heart. This love has taken its toll on me. She said Goodbye too many times before. And her heart is breaking in front of me. I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore.

Then turn around and leave again. This love has taken its toll on me. She said Goodbye too many times before. And her heart is breaking in front of me. I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore. I'll fix these broken things. Repair your broken wings. And make sure everything's alright. My pressure on your hips. Sinking my fingertips.

Hotel California,"On a dark desert highway. Cool wind in my hair. Warm smell of colitas. Rising up through the air. Up ahead in the distance. I saw a shimmering light. My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim. I had to stop for the night. There she stood in the doorway. I heard the mission bell. And I was thinking to myself. This could be heaven or this could be hell. Then she lit up a candle. And she showed me the way. There were voices down the corridor. I thought I heard them say. Welcome to the hotel calif’_rnia. Such a lovely place. Such a lovely face. Plenty of room at the hotel calif’_rnia. Any time of year. You can find it here. Her mind is tiffany-twisted. She got the mercedes-benz. She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys. That she calls friends. How they dance in the courtyard. Sweet summer sweat. Some dance to remember. Some dance to forget. So I called up the captain. Please, bring me my wine. He said. We haven't had that spirit here since. Nineteen sixty-nine. And still those voices. Are calling from far away. Wake you up in the middle of the night. Just to hear them say. Welcome to the hotel calif’_rnia. Such a lovely place. Such a lovely face. We're livin' it up at the hotel california. Any time of year. You can find it here. Welcome to the hotel calif’_rnia. Such a lovely place. Such a lovely face. We're livin' it up at the hotel california. What a nice surprise. Bring your alibis"

"Sunday, Bloody Sunday","I can't believe the news today. I can't close my eyes and make it go away. How long. How long must we sing this song?. How long, how long?. Tonight we can be as one. Tonight. Broken bottles under children's feet. And bodies strewn across a dead end street. But I won't heed the battle call. It puts my back up, puts my back up against the wall. Sunday, bloody sunday. Sunday, bloody sunday. Sunday, bloody sunday. Sunday, bloody sunday. And the battle's just begun. There's many lost but tell me who has won?. The trenches dug within our hearts. And mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart. Sunday, bloody sunday. Sunday, bloody sunday. How long. How long must we sing this song?. How long, how long?. Tonight we can be as one. Tonight. I wipe your tears away. I wipe your tears away. I wipe your tears away. (Sunday, bloody sunday). I wipe your tears away. (Sunday, bloody sunday)"
This Love,I was so high I did not recognize. The fire burning in her eyes. The chaos that controlled my mind. Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane. Never to return again. But always in my heart. This love has taken its toll on me. She said Goodbye too many times before. And her heart is breaking in front of me. I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore. I tried my best to feed her appetite. Keep her coming every night. So hard to keep her satisfied. Kept playing love like it was just a game. Pretending to feel the same. Then turn around and leave again. This love has taken its toll on me. She said Goodbye too many times before. And her heart is breaking in front of me. I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore. I'll fix these broken things. Repair your broken wings. And make sure everything's alright. My pressure on your hips. Sinking my fingertips. Into every inch of you. Cause I know that's what you want me to do. This love has taken its toll on me. She said Goodbye too many times before. And her heart is breaking in front of me. I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore. This love has taken its toll on me. She said Goodbye too many times before. And my heart is breaking in front of me. She said Goodbye too many times before. This love has taken its toll on me. She said Goodbye too many times before. And her heart is breaking in front of me. I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore...

I see a rainbow all in black. Must be a sign you ain't comin' back. Wake up at night callin' your name. I see a face on my window pane. I've been this way since you've been gone. Without your love, I can't go on. Look in the mirror, what do I see?. A cryin' face, kinda looks like me. Now where's the love you promised me?. Where's the tenderness to comfort me?. Everytime some love I choose. I seem to always be the one to lose. Bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears. Heart feels sad 'cause Love's Gone Bad. Love's Gone Bad, heart feels sad. Ooh, Black cruel signing up above. It's a sign I live my life without love. Signs on the man, slime's on the sea. Signs everywhere I said I'm destined to be. And if the world baby nothing's right. Since you've been gone baby. Can't sleep at night. You said you'd be true to me. Instead you made a fool of me. Heart feel sad, Love's Gone Bad. Ouw.... Auw, Love's Gone Bad. Heart feel sad.

It's out of my hands. It's out of my hands. To think for two years she was here. And I took her for granted I was so cavalier. Now the way that it stands. She's out of my hands. So I've learned that love's not possession. And I've learned that love won't wait. Now I've learned that love needs expression. But I learned too late. She's out of my life. She's out of my life. Damned indecision and cursed pride. Kept my love for her locked deep inside. And it cuts like a knife

And folks dressed up like Eskimos. Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe. Help to make the season bright. Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow. Will find it hard to sleep tonight. They know that Santa's on his way. He's bringing lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh. And every mother's child is on the spy. To see if reindeer really know how to fly. And so, I'm offering this simple phrase. To kids from one to ninety-two. Though it has been said many times, many ways. Merry Christmas (Merry Christmas). Merry Christmas (Merry Christmas). Merry Christmas to... you"

Coming Home For Summer,"We started in october. Drowned our sins in cold november rain. Thoughts all through december. Prayed for snow to cover up the pain. Been so long under winter's night. Waiting for the sun. Watching the horizon. Everybody's coming home for summer. But still feels a million miles away. What a feeling, taste the freedom. There with every bite. Finally we're coming home. We shadow-boxed the enemy. Swing until we extradite our fears. Their backed into a corner. Ring the bell, we shed our blood and tears. Like hibernating sun-rays, hoping for the sun. Watching the horizon. Everybody's coming home for summer. But still feels a thousand miles away. What a feeling, taste the freedom. There with every bite. Finally we're coming home. Oh, we suffered in silence. Through storms and through violence. We stayed our way. The waves have sub-sided. Clouds have divided. Found a reason to survive. Found the will to stay alive. That will be the last thing that we do. Heading for summer. Back home for summer. Everybody's coming home for summer. (everybody). But still feels a thousand miles away. What a feeling, (what a feeling). Taste the freedom (taste the freedom). There with every bite. Finally we're coming home. Oh, we're coming home.

If that made sense I'd leave it here. I have no lesser business,. I'm Immaterial but I still got things on a wish list,. This is desire; can't you hear it in my c+ english?. I'd love the finer things but that's. Not being realistic, ballistic,. Everybody goes when I'm singing,. I'm sick of singing pain,. So I'm free, broken, winging,. Coming out my heart purer than the way I'm living,. Maybe I'll see you, or maybe I'll just give in.. Yeah, it's just too much now that I'm all grown up,. I've been dragged through the dirt. Now I should be blowing up,. Still I'm blowing, still I'm blowing,. And still I don't know where the hell I should be going,. So I guess it's just live like this til my mind goes snap,. No love, no drug could ever fill this gap,. Yeah I live for the high until it all floods back,. Like the tears of the years that I can't get back..

Flyin',"Ehh yeahh. And my uproarious arrival pushed the noise to the scene. This inglorious desire that would be left out of me. So I'll be open to rise. And open closed minds, hook lines. I'll make 'em edible. You'll gobble it down. Like it's the only thing that's floating. Hold on or drown. Words can grant your relief. I tell it bitter and sweet. You can twist out the seats. And put the demons to sleep. This is closure. Exposure of the bad things brought to life. So you can face them, spit 'em out or maybe sleep tonight. I soak it up with the shirt off my back. Stay in the music 'til I'm dead on my back. Get 'em vexed and attack and attack and attack and attack. Yeah, I'm passive, they're ecstatic. And it's making me sick. I swim in grease. Spilling drinks on another prick. And I've tried, but it's too hard. So don't tell me to be calm. See, I do drink and I do get high. I throw punches through these blurry eyes. See, 'cus I was raised by a body of life. I've been focused on the ground. so long I lost it with the sky yeah. And the sky's where I'm destined for. They used to tell me that I couldn't soar. But for all my flaws. Looks to me like I'm flying high. Looks to me like I'm flying high yeah. Looks to me like I'm flying high. Looks to me like I'm flying high yeah yeah"
Follow The Leader,"Follow the leader, to the ends of the earth. Follow the leader, I've been there from the birth. Follow the leader, I love all of ya work. Follow the leader, love you so much that it hurts. Follow the leader, leader, leader. I could never leave ya, I am a believer. I have been to see ya in every single region. I've been close enough that I could slash ya with a cleaver. I just really need ya, I could dice you up and keep ya. Stick you on my wall beside a photograph of Bieber. Take you out for walks, introduce you to my people. Peter, Timothy, Alan and Uncle Kiefer. They'd really love to meet ya. Can't believe that soon I'll meet ya. I'm gonna squeeze ya, I'll put you in a sleeper. Take ya home to Peterbrough. Smoke some sour diesel bra. Ah, Raff I'm so eager to meet ya. Chorus. I really hope you'll come back to my house after the show. Coz if you don't I'm afraid that I'll die slow. I'll hold my breath tell these medics there ain't no medicine ready enough to cure such an aching in my soul. My love for you is like no other love that is or ever was. I know your favourite sweet's apple crumble or lemon tops. That fuckin slut was ungrateful, I'd let you were your socks. I'd fuckin wear you to dinner like you're a pair of clogs. I've followed you since you were a flicker in your Mummy's eyes. It's a shame that I can't touch you like it's Hammer-time. I probably shouldn't have done what I did but now I'm fine. I'm sat here reading this letter coz in my camera time. I check myself in the mirror, I see my hands are tied. Can't do the gig with a vest or an Ak49. All the world's a stage, without my fans I'd die. Eh, so I guess I'll fuckin walk the line. Chorus. It's so confusing, you've got colder, you've been using me. I bought you t-shirts and chocolate, I sent you jewellery. Look at what you do to me, I'm crying over stupid shit. Your songs are not about me, I am taking back my jewellery. You're such a fuckin homophobe, I wish I never let you in. To think that I was thinking maybe I should let you live. I'm gonna blow up your family like I'm a terrorist. You were my hero, my Jesus, and now you're my nemesis. I'd climb up on your terrace, menace into your fellowship. I'll slit the throats of your relatives, shoot that Jess in the belly. Feed you heroin, I gave you everything. Now you'll come to bed with me forever, you're in debt with me. Chorus. Is this free? I got the letters you sent for me. St Lukes is where you mother-fuckin sentenced me. I just found your number, your the same one that's been texting me. Stalkin me, there's police outside your house, you'd better talk to me. Yeah, send him in, this creepy cunt's ignoring me. I think I hear something, wait, wait (knock knock knock, knock) yeah. (Telephone voice). My name's Paul, I'm a doorman, I wish my mum had aborted me. I'm divorced and I'm lost at the age of forty-three. I'm dressed up and these people are always calling me. Paul, I'm (metallic poison?) and I'm talking about you constantly. Then I found out you were homophobic and it got me so mad. I slaughtered and decided your homophobia was not gonna watch on me. You were threatening to slaughter me? That's all I need. I will always love you my idol, I guess that's all from me. I'm at your door you see, now try ignoring me. (Fighting and shouting noises). (Shouting: Get the fuck off me, Get off me, Hey, Aargh, Ahh, Oww). Chorus x 3. Follow the leader, to the ends of the earth. Follow the leader, I've been there from the birth. Follow the leader, I love all of ya work. Follow the leader, love you so much that it hurts"

Where my angels dare not tread,"There's people always reaching for my heart. And if they ask me where it is. I wouldn't know where to start. Yeah.

I'm not blinking, I'm tired of being a lynchpin. Lynched for being different. Thinking differently. Tell me, where's humility?. Why'd they got it in for me?. They just want my infamy, to defamate my symphony. But they would have to take every single limb for me. Yeah you won't take away symphony. And I'll be in the corner screaming, screaming.

Tell me what kind of dumb shit I'll do next?. My knees tremble, I panic, I'm too stressed. I try and remember if there's any booze left. Inside the bag in the club, number who's next?. Sends an echo through the stadium, echoing who's next?. I'm next on my way to this huge jest. I sing a song and Nicole told me ""You's blessed"". I was screaming, screaming fuck the world inside my head. It taught me I was a waster, I had no common sense. Now there's cameras and suddenly all the times dead.
