93 Million Miles,"93 million miles from the sun. People get ready, get ready. Cause here it comes, it's a light. A beautiful light, over the horizon. Into our eyes. Oh, my, my, how beautiful. Oh, my beautiful mother. She told me, son, in life you're gonna go far. If you do it right, you'll love where you are. Just know, wherever you go. You can always come home. 240 thousand miles from the moon. We've come a long way to belong here. To share this view of the night. A glorious night. Over the horizon is another bright sky. Oh, my, my, how beautiful. Oh, my irrefutable father. He told me, son, sometimes it may seem dark. But the absence of the light is a necessary part. Just know, you're never alone. You can always come back home. Home. Home. You can always come back. Every road is a slippery slope. But there is always a hand that you can hold on to. Looking deeper through the telescope. You can see that your home's inside of you. Just know, that wherever you go. No, you're never alone. You will always get back home. Home. Home. 93 million miles from the sun. People get ready, get ready. Cause here it comes, it's a light. A beautiful light, over the horizon. Into our eyes"
Rude,"Saturday morning jumped out of bed. And put on my best suit. Got in my car and raced like a jet, all the way to you. Knocked on your door with heart in my hand. To ask you a question.

I hate to do this, you leave no choice, can't live without her. Love me or hate me we will be boys standing at that altar. Or we will run away to another galaxy, you know. You know she's in love with me, she will go anywhere I go. Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?. Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know. You say, ""I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die. Tough luck, my friend, 'cause the answer's still no! "". Why you gotta be so rude?. Don't you know I'm human, too?.

Use Somebody,"I've been roaming around. Always looking down at all I see. Painted faces, build the places I can't reach. You know that I could use somebody. You know that I could use somebody. Someone like you, and all you know, and how you speak. Countless lovers under cover of the street. You know that I could use somebody. You know that I could use somebody. Someone like you.

Someone Like You,"I heard that you're settled down. That you found a girl and you're married now. I heard that your dreams came true. Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you. Old friend, why are you so shy?. Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light. I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited. But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. I had hoped you'd see my face. And that you'd be reminded. That for me it isn't over. Never mind, I'll find someone like you. I wish nothing but the best for you too. Don't forget me, I beg. I remember you said. ""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"". Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah. You'd know how the time flies. Only yesterday was the time of our lives. We were born and raised in a summer haze. Bound by the surprise of our glory days. I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited. But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight. I had hoped you'd see my face. And that you'd be reminded. That for me it isn't over. Nevermind, I'll find someone like you. I wish nothing but the best for you too. Don't forget me, I beg. I remember you said. ""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"". Nothing compares, no worries or cares. Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made. Who would have known how bitter-sweet. This would taste?. Nevermind, I'll find someone like you. I wish nothing but the best for you.

Taste The Feeling,"Feels good, in my heart, in my soul. When you're right here beside me. I don't ever want this day to end. We can watch the wave, have a Coke. And you sit here beside me. Take a little long my heart of me. So we can feel whatever you feel. Together we built, together at. No one can stop me when I taste the feeling. Nothing could ever bring me down. No one can stop me when I taste the feeling. Nothing could ever bring me down. Feels good as we stand on the shore. But our hearts are still jumping. Grab another Coke and let's dive in. Yeah, my love, there's a song in my soul. When you are around me. You make it easier to sing it. So we can feel whatever you feel. Together we built, together at. No one can stop me when I taste the feeling. Nothing could ever bring me down. No one can stop me when I taste the feeling. Nothing could ever bring me down. Feel everything and sensed it. We see the stars aligned. You make the simple moments last for a lifetime. So, we can feel forever. You and me, together. Stay free forever. And be real together. No one can stop me when I taste the feeling. Nothing could ever bring me down. No one can stop me when I taste the feeling. Nothing could ever bring me down"
The Scientist (Coldplay cover),"Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry. You don't know how lovely you are. I had to find you, tell you I need you. And tell you I set you apart. Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions. Oh let's go back to the start. Running in circles, coming up tails. Heads on a science apart. Nobody said it was easy. It's such a shame for us to part. Nobody said it was easy. No one ever said it would be this hard. Oh take me back to the start. I was just guessing at numbers and figures. Pulling the puzzles apart. Questions of science, science and progress. Don't speak as loud as my heart. So tell me you love me, come back and haunt me. Oh, when I rush to the start. Running in circles, chasing in tails. Coming back as we are. Nobody said it was easy. It's such a shame for us to part. Nobody said it was easy. No one ever said it would be so hard. I'm going back to the start. OOhh"
